# This is Jeff's awesome website 
What if I add some text here...?

## Here's a subsection
And here's some additional text...
```{r}
rnorm(10)
```


## Links to other websites
    by format: [text for link](address.of.link)
(if the website has multiple pages, use this way to link them together)

* [Google](https://www.google.com)   
* [P8105](https://www.p8105.com)

## Local image
  by formate: `![](`foldername`/`picture_name`)`

Here is my cat, ted:
![](image/ted.jpg)
(use html directly, since can change jpg style easier): \newline
<img src="image/ted.jpg" style="width:75%>

## Link to page within the site
    by format: [text for link](name of .html)
[About me](about.html)


## _site.yml
All our pages have styling, output, and structure coming from page-specific YAML. Create your _site.yml to have one set of rules that apply site-wide.

How to create: Create _site.yml file by going to File > New File > Text file. save the file as _site.yml in projectâ€™s home folder.

theme: change the background of website (`default theme` in p8105.com)
